Problem:

# Tickets for futbol matches.

Tickets for futbol can be bought online or by telephone (in Argentina), but later on they have to be picked up by the ticket office. This is a big inconvenience when the expectator lives in another city and has to travel to the ticket office just to pick up his ticket.

Mobile tickets and qr codes are not considered as an option as there is a big space of forgery.

NFTs are a solution to this problem. They are a digital representation of a physical object. They are stored in the blockchain and can thus cannot be changed. There is only one owner of the NFT representation of the ticket.

Optionally ticket can be transferrable.

#Workflow

- NFT is transferable? In case user can't attend.
